# AQI-Check

This project uses Python and data visualization libraries like pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to analyze and visualize Air Quality Index (AQI) data. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the analysis includes cleaning, exploration, and visualization of air quality parameters across different states and years.

The primary objectives that were achieved in the project are:

Data Loading and Cleaning
Data Analysis and Visualization
Correlation Analysis
Temporal Analysis
Location-wise Analysis

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/AQI-Check-Project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run the main Python script:
```bash
cd AQI-Check-Project
python main.py
```

or

```bash
Just open the cmd in the project(current) folder and write "jupyter notebook"
```
